# PiggyBank
A tool I made to project personal funds and export to a csv file.  Threw it together quickly so code is not very pretty.

# Requirements
- Python 2
- pip install pandas

# How to run
- Clone or download repo
- Edit budget.txt in PiggyBank/  (there are notes in there on what to input)
- Double click run_mac or run_windows located in launchers/ (make a shortcut and 
  copy wherever you want, add the piggyBank icon in PiggyBank/resources :D)
  This will parse budget.txt and run the algorithm, then output a csv file to output/
